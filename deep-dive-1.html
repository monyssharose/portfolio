		<h1>Map of top tourist destinations in Rome, Italy</h1>
		<h3>(including Vatican City)</h3>
		<p>For my deep dive, I wanted to depict some of the most popular tourist destinations in Rome, Italy.</p>
		<p>I visited Italy about 10 years ago and of all the places I visited, Rome was my favorite. I chose to center my map on the Colosseum - arguably the most popular tourist destination in Rome.</p>
		<p>My favorite areas and tourist destinations in Rome, Italy, were, of course, the most popular amongst visitors. I wanted to share this information with users and hopefully even demonstrate their proximity to each other - which is within walking distance</p>
