		<h1>Top tourist destinations in Rome, Italy</h1>
		<h3>(including Vatican City)</h3>
		<p>For my deep dive, I wanted to depict some of the most popular tourist destinations in Rome, Italy.</p>
		<p>I traveled to Italy about 10 years ago and of all the places I visited, Rome was my favorite. I chose
			<br>to center my map on the Colosseum - arguably the most popular tourist destination in Rome.</p>
		<p>My favorite areas and tourist destinations in Rome, Italy, were, of course, the most popular amongst
			<br>visitors. I wanted to share this information with users and hopefully even demonstrate their proximity
			<br>to each other - which is within walking distance.</p>
